# acp

![demo.gif](media/demo.gif)

Highlights (aka "Why making another file-transfer tool?"):

- Designed for personal use; no need to copy-paste a token / code for each transfer
- Rendezvous service runs distributively on [serverless edge function](https://deno.com/deploy/docs),
  a robust solution with low latency worldwide. ([How does this work?](docs/mechanism.md))

Other features:

- End-to-end encryption (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- P2P connection: LAN or WAN, with NAT transversal
- Compression (gzip)
- Cross platform: Linux, macOS, Windows
- Support transfering multiple files and directories

## Get started

### Linux, macOS

On any of your machine, run

```bash
curl -fsS https://acp.deno.dev/get | sh
```

It sets up the current machine by downloading an executable and generating an identity.
By default the install path is `/usr/local/bin`; you can change it by `curl -fsS 'https://acp.deno.dev/get?dir=/path/to/bin' | sh`
At the end, it prints out the command for setting up your other machines.
You can run `acp --setup` any time you want to see the command.

### Windows

Currently there is no installation script for PowerShell (PR welcomes :)
You can download the released executable and put it on your `Path`.
Then run `acp --setup` to generate an identity.


## Usage

```bash
# sender
acp path/to/files

# receiver, to $(pwd)
acp
# or receive to/as specified target
acp -d path/to/target
```

You can run the sender and receiver in arbitrary order.
Whenever both sides are up and running, they will attempt to establish a P2P connection.
If you see messages such as `rendezvous timeout`, at least one side is behind a firewall or a strict NAT that prohibits P2P connection.

For advanced configuration and self-hosting (it's free & takes only 5 minutes!), check out [the docs here](docs/advanced.md).
